# siegecraft

is my attempt at making a full 2D Godot game for a coding challenge (siege.hackclub.com),
where I had to follow the theme: GRID. I did not anticipate for me to
implement this little features in ~14 hours, so written below is everything
you can (not) do in Siegecraft!


(You can see in my code that I prepared everything for the features,
the time just wasn't sufficient xd)

- Static floor generation with dynamic tree generation (location & frequency)
